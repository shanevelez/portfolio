🧑‍💻 Shane Velez – Developer Portfolio
A portfolio of internal tools and automation projects built in React + Tailwind, showcasing real-world solutions I’ve developed for a 1000+ student school using low-code, Python, and Power Platform.

I had no experience with React or Tailwind three days before I built this site — this portfolio is proof I can pick up any stack.
